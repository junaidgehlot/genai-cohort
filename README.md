# 🔐 Simple Tokenizer

A minimal Python utility to **encode** and **decode** text using ASCII values. This script converts characters into their corresponding ASCII codes and vice versa, allowing for simple reversible transformation of strings.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- **`vocab()`**  
  Generates a dictionary of supported characters and their ASCII values.

- **`encoder(sentence)`**  
  Converts a string into a list of ASCII tokens.

- **`decoder(tokens)`**  
  Converts a list of ASCII tokens back into the original string.

- **`start()`**  
  Interactive CLI that asks the user whether they want to encode or decode.
